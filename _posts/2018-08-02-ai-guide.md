### Introduction

Popularity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has exploded in the past few years
mainly due to technologies such as Big Data, Cloud Computing, GPUs and
advancement in AI algorithms.

Big Data technologies like Hadoop and Spark have made data collection, data
analysis and data cleaning easier. Cloud Computing** **makes deploying models
cheaper** **while GPUs shortens the time it takes to train a model. Advancements
in machine learning especially in deep learning frameworks has increased the
accuracy of the models.

Today, anyone, anywhere in the world with an Internet connection can leverage
the concepts in this article to create their own AI. AI can be used to predict
anything, the only condition being that you have the relevant data (and lots of
it!)

### Machine learning

Machine learning is a branch of statistics which analyzes data and generates
patterns in it. There are three categories of machine learning; descriptive,
predictive and prescriptive.

The three major types of machine learning are; supervised, unsupervised and
reinforcement leaning.

### Deep Learning

Deep learning or deep neural networks is a branch of machine learning which use
an interconnected layer of calculators known as neurons which ingest large
amounts of data in its input layers, digests it in its hidden layers and produce
results in its output layers. Deep learning techniques are widely used by most,
if not all major IT companies as their accuracy especially in image, voice and
facial recognition is leaps and bounds above traditional machine learning
algorithms.

There are many types of deep learning frameworks; boltzmann machine,
autoencoders, capsule networks, general adversarial networks etc. In this
article, we will focus on convolutional and recurrent neural networks.
