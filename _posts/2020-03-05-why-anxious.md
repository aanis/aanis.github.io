> Anxiety is the act of controlling the uncontrollable.

There are two types of anxiety; rational and irrational. It is often hard to convince oneself which one you are experiencing as both are based on the possibility of the "worst case scenario" unfolding. Rational anxiety acts as a reminder of an approaching situation. Whereas irrational anxiety is an obsession over the worst case scenatio. 

Anxiety seems to serve an evolutionary purpose. The species that was fearful and calculative out-survived the careless and the woeful. Anxiety is rightly a disorder but to the anxious one cannot extinguish the possibility of the adverse not happening. Anxious people might be irrational but they’re not delusional. An anxious person is much smarter than an average person because they can think deeply about the possibility of things going wrong; hence aiding in self-preservation. 

An antidote which I’ve found helps me is, calculating the probability of an adverse situation actuating.  If the probability of an event occurring is less than ten percent one might distract oneself and not bother over it. Man is a smart animal yet most, if not all of his actions cause all his problems and that is the cost of action. The fact that we can control all exit scenarios of an action is impossible. We anxious ridden meat vehicles should realize that mistakes happen and if we can cause them, we can also find a way to rectify them and live our lives side by side with anxiety.
