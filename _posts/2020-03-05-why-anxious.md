> Anxiety is the act of controlling the uncontrollable.

We get rational anxiety, which acts as a reminder of an approaching pertinent situation or   irrational anxiety, which is a form of an obsessive-compulsive disorder, which prompts your mind to the possibility of something going terribly wrong.  

Anxiety seems to have an evolutionary role. The species, which was fearful and calculative out, survived the careless and woeful. But is the bad anxiety the obsessive realization of the worst-case scenario, which tortures the mind. Anxiety is rightly a disorder but to the anxious one cannot extinguish the possibility of the adverse (whatever worries them) in not happening. Anxious people might be irrational but they’re not improbable. An anxious person is much smarter than an average person because they can think deeply about the possibility of things going wrong; hence aiding in self-preservation. 

An antidote which I’ve found helps me is calculating the probabilities of an adverse situation actuating.  If the probability of an event occurring is less than 10 percent one might distract oneself in not bothering over it. Man is a smart animal yet most if not his doing causes all his problems and there is nothing that can stop him. The fact that we can control all scenarios is absolutely ridiculous. We anxious ridden meat vehicles should realize that mistakes happen and if we can cause them we can also find a way  to rectify them.
