#### Lets start with **a simple thought experiment:**

A man in Germany was going to his lover’s house. On the way he decided to take a
shortcut to avoid the brother of his lover. By making this small unbeknownst
decision the man got involved in an accident which caused his untimely death.

This man was the great-grand father of Adolf Hitler. His lover Hitler’s
great-grand mother. Because he died; Hitler was never born. If this thought
experiment were true, which could easily been have. Could you picture society
today? Of course it is impossible to know but today’s reality would have been
far different than we could perceive.

This example is just a small hypothetical representation of a decision which
would have caused the present human history to fundamentally change.

Now think about all the decisions every human makes and how it is inextricably
linked to one another.

Every decision we make commences a **domino effect**. Think of decisions as a
precursor to the domino effect.

A domino effect in simple terms is any event which causes a chain reaction.

*****

#### But wait!

There is no “single” decision being made in the world.

Every second over 7 billion decision makers around the world are all creating
ripples in the fabric of reality making up a **global domino effect**.

A global domino effect where decisions are inextricably linked to one another
causing infinite probability of realities at any given point in space-time.

Just think about that for a minute.

Every single decision you or others have made or will make will impact the
future of humanity.

*****

#### So what does it mean?

The reality is we do not possess the capability to measure or calculate this
domino effect. These dominoes are invisible and the probabilities of outcomes
infinitesimal.

These web of decisions can be attributed as realities. Realities can be
construed as infinite outcomes of human history. Constantly changing having far
reaching consequences in the future oblivious to human understanding.

An underground river of time which exists but cannot be seen.

Now think about the **universal domino** which is in effect.

We can argue that the start of the big bang was the first domino.

What happened in the first trillionth trillionth trillionth of a second in the
life of the universe set motion to the first domino.

But what we can infer is that there is a domino of infinitesimal probabilities
all around you.
