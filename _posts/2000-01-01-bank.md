### Background

The World Bank Big Data Project pertains to the entire educational public and
private school data for the biggest province of Pakistan, Punjab for the year
2015, 2016 and 2017. The three year period serve a purpose to compare progress
or lack thereof between the years and correlate the data with policies enacted
each year. The dataset has petabytes of data stored in different tables across
various databases with complicated data formats. The job of the data detective
is to sift through it using SQL.

### Tableau

Here we will use the Enterprise Data Visualization tool Tableau which allows us
to join multiple tables within a database using their visual datastructure tool. 
It has a query builder for write custom SQL queries to filter data by date (day,
month, year). Tableau utilizes OpenStreetMap to filter data by geographic coordinates (latitude, latitude).
Tableau also lets you create your own custom calculations which are beneficial when you are playing with
ratios, percentages, mean, median or mode. Tableau also allows the user to filter, hide and edit fields, rows and values.

### Summary

This is just a snapshot of the individual graphs which are part of a
comprehensive dashboard with statistics, graphs, widgets, maps, bubbles, and
heatmaps. The full World Bank dashboard has 5 variations and has over 40+
graphs.
