### Introduction

There has been a lot of debate between which is better a platform for Big Data
Hadoop or Spark. Both are completely different platforms which were made for
different purposes. I hope after reading this post you can understand the
technology behind Hadoop and Spark and identify which platform better suits your
company’s and clients’ needs.

*****

### What is Hadoop?

The first think you need to realize is that Hadoop is NOT a database.

Hadoop is not going to replace traditional database and data warehouse
architectures. Hadoop is a distributed fault tolerant file sharing ecosystem.

What Hadoop offers is parallel processing which makes it convenient for you to
run many jobs in parallel. But keep in mind all these jobs have to be run on
disk. Hadoop uses MapReduce a computational model which breaks down and
aggregates tasks across your database which speeds up the DB performance.

HDFS or Hadoop File System is used to reduce redundancy and include parallelism
which might not exist in traditional RBMS. Traditional databases have ACID
properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability) something absent
in Hadoop. So, every time you have to run a job you will have to code that
manually in MapReduce. Ouch!

Is Hadoop faster in processing jobs than RBMS? Yes!

But,

Hadoop is also not fit for real-time data applications; its not fast in joining
multiple data sets, has problems in scalability *(operated by single master)*
and doesn't have storage or network level encryption. With Hadoop you will
always have to use a database systems like HBase, Impala or Cassandra and for
analytics something like Hive on top.

Hive is primarily used on top of Hadoop for SQL abstractions of MapReduce as
writing jobs in Java for MapReduce is hectic and time consuming.

### What is Spark?

Spark is an engine for large scale data processing with a focus on data science
and data analytics but has evolved for real-time streaming as well.

#### Why Use Spark?

1.  Spark uses a DAG *(directed acyclic graph)* engine which is 100x in-memory
faster than MapReduce and 10x in-disk faster than Hadoop
1.  Spark is platform agnostic so it can work on top of Hadoop, Cassandra, Mesos,
Hbase and is compatible with languages like SQL, Python, Java, Scala and R
1.  Spark is an all-in-one platform with; Spark SQL, Spark Streaming, MLib, GraphX
and SparkR

### Spark Architecture

<span class="figcaption_hack">Spark Core Engine and the apps on top of it</span>

**Spark Core Engine** is the foundation block of the Spark Architecture and is
responsible for task distribution, scheduling and input/output.

Spark introduced RDD *(Resilient Distributed Dataset)* which is an immutable
fault-tolerant, distributed collection of objects that can be operated on in
parallel an evolution on Hadoop’s MapReduce.

RDDs support two types of operations:

* **Transformations** which are operations such as *(map, filter, join, union)*
* **Actions** which are operations such as *(reduce, count, first)*

**Transformation** in Spark are lazy* *because they do not compute the result
instantly, they just remember the operation performed on the data set.

**Actions** has to be used to compute the results.

Thus the transformations and actions technique makes Spark faster and more
efficient in its computation.

**Spark SQL** supports querying data via SQL but before you can use SQL you need
to develop the relevant table structures or data frames *(pandas in python).*

**Spark Streaming** supports real time processing of streaming data and converts
the input data stream into batches. Spark Core generates the final stream of the
processed data. These micro batches are supported by the lambda architecture*
(it aggregates old data on top of new one).*

**MLib** is the machine learning library of Spark which supports all leading
algorithms like classification, regression, clustering and collaborative
filtering.

**GraphX** is a library for manipulating graphs and performing graph-parallel
operations based on data frames. It provides a useful tool for ETL, exploratory
analysis and iterative graph computations.

**SparkR** connects R language to the Spark framework, so you can use all the
components of the R framework.

### Why Spark is better?

Before 2013, Hadoop was the king of data processing but today Spark because of
its fast in-memory processing is used by companies like Oracle, Hortonworks,
Cisco, Verizon, Visa, Microsoft, Databricks and Amazon.

The advantages of Spark is the seamless integration of existing frameworks and a
fusion of machine learning, business intelligence and analytics with real-time
processing.

**A poll from Apache Foundation asked companies why they used Spark**

**Answer:**

* 91% use Apache Spark because of its performance gains
* 77% use Apache Spark as it is easy to use
* 71% use Apache Spark due to the ease of deployment
* 64% use Apache Spark to leverage advanced analytics
* 52% use Apache Spark for real-time streaming

So if you are a data engineer, data scientist or application developer and want
to leverage Big Data Spark is the perfect platform for you.

### Use Cases of Spark

1.  **IoT applications** in connected devices and sensors
1.  **Predictive Analytics** for real-time analytics and probabilistic forecasting
of customers, products and partners
1.  **Anomaly Detection** for real-time anomalies in financial fraud, structural
defects, potential medical conditions
1.  **Personalization** for delivering a custom-tailored experience in real-time for
your customers

*****

### Conclusion

Spark is a platform which improved upon Hadoop and was made especially keeping
in mind the growing demands of real-time Big Data.

However, you will still find Hadoop in a lot of companies who invested heavily
in distributed computing before 2013 but the good thing is you can run Spark on
top of Hadoop and get the best of both worlds.

Is Spark better than Hadoop, I think so. The ease of use, speed, multi-language
support, multi-framework capacity and diverse use cases makes it a winner for
me.

Winner: *Spark!*
