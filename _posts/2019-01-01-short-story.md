I sat in my car and drove to Herbert’s house. Herbert although not a close
friend, was one of my oldest. We met each other at our chemistry program at the
prestigious Wells university. I dropped out in the second semester due to poor
performance in most, if not all of my courses. To this day my parents contend I
was summarily booted, but I would like to think that chemistry and I just don't
mix.

I parked outside Herbert’s driveway and tooted the horn. My car door flung open
as Herbert sat in my old’s mobile. I was quite certain it was Herbert and not a
stranger. You see I couldn't be sure it was him because he didn't speak a word
or by the fact that I couldn't see him. Herbert was invisible. It was a rather
unfortunate accident that caused his invisibility.

Herbert finally grunted and I was finally at ease. “Speak up, will you
Herbert!”, I exclaimed emphatically. “You know I can't see you!”. “How many
invisible people do you know of?”, Herbert sarcastically replied. “Well before
you no one, but now that we know its possible don't you think someone might
have formulated a potion by now?” I mocked. Herbert did not reply,
he sighed heavily. I throttled the gas and started driving.

Predictably, Herbert started rambling about how difficult it was to meet new
people (*especially women*) with his unusual condition. Although the notion of dating
someone invisible is quite exciting at first (*by Herbert’s account*),
it loses its charm rather quickly. Who knew that all relationships would eventually
boil down to trivial mundanities of personal chemistry, compatibility, shared
world view and values? But as Herbert was blabbering about the unfairness of his
predicament, I was thinking entirely about something else.

Herbert did not become invisible by accident. 

Although the probability of such bizarre occurrence cannot be computed let alone
comprehended by a human brain. My deduction was not scientific but rather
metaphysical. I had been to many social events, gatherings and parties with
Herbert, but his presence had always been uneventful. I am certain he was never absent, 
he had always accompanied me. But inevitably he would dissipate in the background like a spectre.

Herbert by all accounts was not quiet because he was antisocial or introverted. He was quiet
because he was selfish. (*This theory was concocted by my dear Elizabeth.
Elizabeth was an arm chair psychologist but I wouldn't discredit her because of
her lack of credentials*). Elizabeth theorized that Herbert’s reluctance to
socialize stemmed from his selfishness. He simply would not partake in any
conversation that was not about him.

The more I pondered over this thought, the stronger my affirmations of this
theory grew. Herbert had always been invisible to me. He never wanted to
earnestly connect nor was he ever empathetic or genuine like a good friend ought
to be.

It was just now, that I could **see** him.
