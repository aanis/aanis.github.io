lie open bare

arms entrenched softly

cozy on a bosom

dreaming soaring breathing

spy not

iâ€™m too vulnerable

mystic eyes

penetrating holograms

matter forgotten

certainty begone

microscopic static

knocks one over

elements entwine

seamless

nocturnal violations

sideline dispensation

moisture devouring

exalted/mistaken/disbelief

she gathers all

before she leaves
