let me drive you to the desert I'll show you around

speeding down route 62 I'll be your lucky charm

the four wheeler breaks down at joshua tree

where tarantulas come outside for souls to reap

sun sets below the seductive desert curves

two damaged goods walking alone on earth

buckle up this is a one way ride

no hitchhiking at the stop signs

vultures awaiting at cobwebbed diners

liquor bottles hurled at misfit lovers

sand in my hair shooting stars at your feet

i kneel down and pick em up slowly

you look like a vision in the pale moonlight

my mind wanders to the ocean as I gaze in your eyes

you're heart is mine to forever keep

how often do you reckon two souls meet
