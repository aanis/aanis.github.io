This complete beginner friendly **Zero to Hero™** guide was written to help
**YOU** in becoming an Artificial Intelligence Expert. After completing this
guide not only will you master AI concepts but become an AI Expert by actually
**DOING** the work and completing projects.

I strongly believe that we learn the most by actually **doing** things rather
than reading or memorizing them. This guide was written especially in mind for
those who actually want to become **competent** at AI.

I am confident after completing this guide you can work as an AI Developer, AI
Freelancer and ever create your own AI startup.

### Understand The Basics

Before you start your journey into AI, you need to know what machine learning is
and how it works. We briefly cover the basics of deep learning (the go-to AI
architecture nowadays).

1.  [Understand Machine
Learning](/_posts/2019-01-01-dummy-ml.md)
(2 mins)
2.  [Understand the Math behind
AI](/_posts/2019-01-01-dummy-math.md)
(10 mins)
3.  [Understand the basics of Python for
AI](/_posts/2019-01-01-dummy-python.md) (10
mins)
4.  [Understand what a Simple Neural Net is
](/_posts/2019-01-01-neural-net.md)(2
mins)
5.  [Understand what Data Normalization
is](/_posts/2019-01-01-dummy-data.md)
(2 mins)
6.  [Understand Gradient Descent and Backpropagation
](/_posts/2019-01-01-dummy-grad.md)(2 mins)

**Pro Tip:** Cheat Sheet of Machine Learning Algorithms
[here](http://ml-cheatsheet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

After you have completed these 5 short easy-to-digest guides and mastered the
basics of machine learning lingo, programming and math basics you **NEED** to
enroll and finish the next two courses to become an AI hero.

### **Must Do Courses To Become An AI Hero**

### [Andrew Ng Machine Learning Course on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) (11 weeks)

[Mini cheat sheet for the course](https://medium.com/@lahorekid/cheat-sheet-for-andrew-ngs-machine-learning-course-on-coursera-9933ee3b608f)
(2 mins)

[Detailed cheat sheet for the course](https://www.slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/a-developers-guide-to-machine-learning#stats-panel) (20mins)

**Note:** This course will teach you to implement popular machine algorithms;
Linear and Logistic Regression, Neural Nets, Support Vector Machines, K-means,
PCA, Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems.

**Pro Tip**: This course is in Octave, I recommend doing the assignments in
Python instead. Solution to Assignments in Python
[here](https://github.com/JWarmenhoven/Coursera-Machine-Learning)

*****

### [Google’s Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/) (15 hours)

[Mini cheat sheet for the course](https://medium.com/@lahorekid/cheat-sheet-for-googles-machine-learning-crash-course-53f401ff0356)
(2 mins)

**Note:** This course will teach you neural nets and is in Tensorflow Google’s
Deep Learning framework.

**Pro Tip:** Tensorflow tutorial can be found
[here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)

After completing these courses you will have a clear understanding of AI and
Deep Learning concepts and best practices.

### Course To Become An Deep Learning Master

If you want to further hone your skills in Deep Learning and become a master
enroll in:

### [Andrew Ng’s Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) (5 courses)

[Detailed cheat sheet for the course](https://www.slideshare.net/TessFerrandez/notes-from-coursera-deep-learning-courses-by-andrew-ng) (30 mins)
