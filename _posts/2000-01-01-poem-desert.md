after some cool beers the heart settles down

the dust resonates in the desert

a flash of fire lights the sky

something ancient is brewing

the moon reveals its mammary glands

as i open my mouth for the offering

the spring air wheezes in the lungs

as the alveoli chime with joy

the inanimate objects don't seem dull anymore

insignificance doesn't ring anymore

this is a strange moment

like all those unexplained moments

after dark

whoever said silence is golden

was a fucking genius
