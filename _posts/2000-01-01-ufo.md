The UFO phenomenon that has been a recent addition to the fringe science zeitgeist most notably popularized during the Second World War. Allied pilots would report sightings of Foo Fighters or Fire Fighters with Foo being the use the word Feu (meaning Fire in French). Glowing orbs emitting light and travelling at speeds much faster than the fighter jets of the era including Messerschmitt Me 163 which had an airspeed record of 702mph in 1944. 

The word UFO or UAP as the United States Air Force likes to call it is a representation of an unidentified aircraft.

A UFO can be of two origins either: Terrestrial or Extraterrestrial/Inter/Intra Dimensional/ Unidentifiable Origin

The idea of alien life does not seem far fetched. The universe as we know today is around 13.8 billion years old. As the observable universe is constantly expanding, the distance to the edge is about 46 billion light years. And within the vastness of the cosmos are billions of galaxies, solar systems and planets like our own. There are 10^11 (100 hundred billion) solar systems alone in the Milky Way Galaxy. 

The notion that life evolved from single cellular goo into technological sentient bipedal apes on just one planet, in the entire universe, is not only hubristic by down right improbable. It is foolish to discredit life in space when there are millions of species on the land in the water here on Earth. 

The Drake’s equation - a probability equation of calculating intelligent life informs us that us being alone is mathematically unsound.

Even if most life does not pass the Great Filter - a test civilization needs to pass before interstellar travel it is still rational to assume that a dozen civilizations should have passed the test. If a civilization passes the test, it is also rational to assume they have an interest in exploring the universe.

Now that we have established that we should not be alone in the universe just like we were not at the center of it, let's find out if we have been visited.

The UFO debate like any interesting narrative attracts a large diaspora of people; scientists, skeptics, believers, conspiracy theorists and debunkers.

The people with credibility are few and far between. The two individuals which I have studied extensively are - Dr. J. Allen Hynek of Project Sign, Grudge and Blue Book and his protégé Dr. Jacques Vallée. Both individuals spent a lifetime studying, documenting and analyzing reports. Dr. Jacques Vallée is a reputed computer scientist credit for the invention of Apranet a precursor to the Internet.
Both individuals make a strong case for the UFO phenomenon. Their literature is a mandatory prerequisite for the subject matter.

In order to understand any complex subject - we first have to divide its sum into divisible sub-units. For brevity’s sake lets break down the phenomenon into four subcategories:

1. Roswell Incident Of 1947
2. Area 51
3. Historical Sightings
4. Modern Sightings 

Lets dive deeper into these 4 subcategories:

The Roswell incident of 1947 was the hyperbole big bang of the UFO phenomenon. The story goes that a flying saucer with alien beings crashed near Roswell, New Mexico in 1947. The conspiracy of Roswell emanated from a headline by the local newspaper, Roswell Daily Record, which read “RAAF Captures Flying Saucer On Ranch In Roswell Region”. This news clipping opened the Pandora’s box of conspiracy theories and cover-ups of retrieved flying saucer and alien beings by the U.S. Air Force. 

The U.S. Air Force officially stated that a weather balloon had crashed from the, then classified Project Mogul; where high-altitude balloons were being used to detect radiation from nuclear bombs by the Soviets. 

So which is more likely? That an alien spaceship capable of traveling millions of light years, ripping the fabric of space-time apart and crashed at its destination or that a spy balloon from a top secret project had technical failures and fell on a random ranch?

Technologically advanced alien species crashing on some poor farmer’s ranch would be similar to an airplane crashing near an Ape colony in Congo. At least we would recover the wreckage, survivors or dead bodies than let the Apes sort out our mess.

Area 51 is a top secret military base in Nevada adjacent to Groom Lake. It has become the Mecca of ufologists since the infamous Bob Lazar came forward in 1989 with the allegation that alien aircrafts were being back engineered there. Lazar doesn’t carry much credibility as he lied about his education at Caltech and MIT. Still, there is a high probability he worked at the base not as a physicist, as he claims but more as a technician like he did at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Since WWII, Area 51 has been widely known as the testing grounds for cutting-edge U.S. Air Force aerospace technology. The U.S. Air Force might be working on disc-shaped fighter, stealth or experimental aircraft. Even the Nazis were making disc-shaped flying machines and Project Paperclip recruited the same scientists to the then top secret U.S. Space Program. So, it’s not far fetched to assume that the U.S. Air Force has since made significant breakthroughs in the not-so-secret Nazi flying-saucer project.

We all know how easily nuclear technology disseminated and or proliferated from the U.S. to Soviet Union and the rest of the world. So a disinformation campaign would actually be in the national interest of the U.S. government. The U.S. government would much rather prefer the world believe it has alien spaceships than ultra-high-speed-evasive aircraft.

Dr. Jacques Vallée has a multifaceted approach to the phenomenon but at its crux he purports that we are dealing with a a sociological phenomenon as much as a physical one. If you've read Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by historian Yuval Noah Harari, its underlying thesis, is some-what similar - the success of our species predicated on our ability to organize and cooperate via abstract sociological narratives. Dr. Vallée purports that our belief in UFO’s is similar to past held beliefs in the paranormal (ghosts, fairies, demons) and that the phenomenon reveals itself with the perpetuating beliefs of the era it operates in.

Where I disagree which Dr. Vallée is his insistence on the existence of this phenomenon. He believes it is intelligent, trickster in nature and that it deceives us of its true nature and motives. Playing humans, like a cat by a shoe string.

There are four reason I disagree with Dr. Vallée:

1. The power of folklore: Our persistent belief in ancient myths and ideologies which no evidence is a careful reminder of our ineptitude to observe reality. 

2. Misclassified natural phenomenon: The phenomenon can be explained much clearer by natural events like ball lightning, meteor shower, celestial objects or satellites in close Earth orbit.

3. The hallucinatory nature of the brain: Manifested through lucid dreams and mental disorders like schizophrenia occupied with visual and auditory hallucinations.

4. The potency of psychoactive drugs: Found in nature like ayahuasca, psilocybin and cannabis which have a psychoactive affect on the processes of the brain.

The crux of the matter is that we are pattern-seeking apes, if a natural phenomenon doesn’t match our pattern rolodex we force a narrative or concoct one. Yet, I am open to the idea of an otherworldly presence amongst us interdimensional or unexplainable. But even if the phenomenon is real, there is no way of measuring it. The limit of science is our scientific method. If something is unfalsifiable it is unscientific.

To be fair in recent times there have been hundreds of sightings reported by fighter pilots, commercial airline pilots, air-traffic controllers and radar technicians. As ridicule and reputation go hand-in-hand with the UFO subject, the sheer number of reports by these experts would imply something odd is flying through the air. Even if we dismiss 99% of the reports across the board. The remaining 1% would imply; unidentifiable activity from people who are paid to identify it.

The UFO phenomenon is worth researching and would be absolved of the stigma if more credible and scientific minded people entered the field.  It is highly probable that the U.S. Government possess proprietary aerospace technology which at its core, not just state-of-the-art but truly revolutionary. Does the technology use gravity? Maybe, maybe not. But anything which flies faster than an F-18 would imply an understanding of physics, mainstream science is devoid of. This fact, does leave me skeptical of U.S. Air Force possessing such breakthrough technology. However, the U.S. Government spends more money on black budget classified projects than any nation on Earth. So development of exotic technology by employing world class scientists with limitless budget is not outside the realm of possibility. The surest way to keep the technology hidden would be, either deny its existence or use disinformation tactics and call it other worldly.

But can I be wrong, and can UFO’s be in fact extraterrestrial?

Yes, as a scientist I have to be open to such possibility. If its truly extraterrestrial then be rest assured no one has the answers; no cabal, no shadowy organization, not even the bigwigs at the Pentagon. 

Arthur C. Clarke famously said: 

*“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”*

If there are aliens, we might as well call them magicians.
