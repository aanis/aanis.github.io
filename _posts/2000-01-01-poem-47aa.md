we sit in moon base four-seven-a-a

i don't know why they call it that

but there is no reason behind

most things i have ever learned

we sit in an auditorium about hundred kids

with tongues rolled backwards

eyeballs somersaulting in our skulls

on looking the podium pretending

to listen to the special guest lecturer

a couple slips to the restroom

muffled moans caress our pubic hair

girls giggle and boys tremble

in an amusement park not far from here

a spherical structure revolves

earth

from my seat i gaze at the structure

deja vu

the invigilator catches me waving my stick

the kids laugh maniacally sheer hysteria

soon the lecturer retires unexpected silence falls

there's no sound except flickering of the projector

outside stillness

thoughts of asphyxiation make me uncomfortable

i gaze at the empty space through the polished glass

even those legs at nine' o clock

could not steal my concentration

as I'd drift away in silent motion
