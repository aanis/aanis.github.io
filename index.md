___

My data science journey started unknowingly in 2008 when I enrolled as an undergraduate at Indiana University. I choose to study economics because I was trading in stocks and options at the time and thought my major should complement my extra-curricular activities. I was barely paying attention in classes as I was always trading between the hours of 9:30am and 4pm EST.

After graduating in 2011, I felt a burnout from the stress of trading (high leverage positions and poor college student do not mix well!) and decided to move to California to make up for the lost sunshine. The most enjoyable aspect of trading was the research I had to do, reading SEC filings, and crunching financial number from Bloomberg reports. Luckily, I got a job at a tech firm in Gardena, CA and after orientation choose to work as a data analyst. 

I really enjoyed learning new technologies, coding and socializing with my nerdy peers. I had finally found my [Ikigai](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Ikigai-EN.svg). After working for a few years, I decided to go for my masters in Information Systems and Decision Sciences at California State University in Fullerton. I was living in Orange County, near the beach and loving every minute of my graduate coursework.

After graduation, I returned to my home country of Pakistan to spend time with my family after being away for 9 years. During this time, I started working as Head Data Scientist and Manager of Data Science for the Government. During this time I also became Dean of Lahore School of AI and started my own AI firm.

I have led and successfully completed data science projects with business intelligence, data warehouse, network analysis, machine learning and deep learning components. I like learning new technologies and a big fan of open source projects. In my free time I am either catching on REM sleep, playing with my dog, watching the UFC and powerlifting at a local gym near you!

The journey continues...
