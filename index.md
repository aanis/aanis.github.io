My data science journey started unbeknownst to me in 2008 when I enrolled as an undergraduate at Indiana University. I choose to study economics because I was trading stocks and options at the time and thought my major should complement my extra-curricular activities. I was barely paying attention in classes as I was always trading between the hours of 9:30am and 4pm.

After graduating in 2011, I felt a burnout from the stress of trading and decided to move to California for a change of landscape (sunshine and sandy beaches mostly). The most enjoyable aspect of trading was the research I had to do, reading SEC filings, and crunching financial number from Bloomberg reports to find undervalued stocks. Luckily soon after arriving to LA, I got a job at [En Pointe Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/En_Pointe_Technologies) and started working as a data analyst at their headquarters at El, Segundo, CA.

I really enjoyed learning new technologies, coding and socializing at happy hours with my co-workers. It was a happy moment in my life, I had stumbled on my [Ikigai](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/18/Ikigai-EN.svg). After working for a few years, I decided to go for my masters in Information Systems and Decision Sciences at California State University in Fullerton. What more could I ask; I was living in Orange County, near the beach, playing poker on the weekends and loving every minute of my graduate coursework.

After graduation, I returned to my home country of Pakistan to spend time with my family after being away for 9 years. During this time, I started working as Head Data Scientist and Manager of Data Science for the Government. During this time, I also became Dean for [School of AI](lahorekid.github.io/assets/pdfs/SchoolofAI.pdf) and started my own AI firm [Hyperleap](http://hyperleap.ai).

On my data science journey, I have led teams and completed projects with business intelligence, data warehouse, network analysis, machine learning and deep learning components. I like learning new technologies and am a big fan of open source projects. In my free time I am either catching on REM sleep, playing with my dog, watching the UFC, powerlifting at my local gym, writing articles and working on my book. 

The journey continues...
