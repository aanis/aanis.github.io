Ahsan enjoys writing, coding and tweeting aphorisms.
He is a science fiction enthusiast, a cinephile, a connoisseur
of metal music and enjoys stoic philosophy. If you can't find him
in front of a computer he is either at the gym or the dog park. 

p.s. 
If he sees a mountain, he will try to climb it.
